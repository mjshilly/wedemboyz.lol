        <b>The Dallas Cowgirls are currently 2-2</b><br><br>The Cowgirls secured a second win of the season. They barely beat out the NYG in an ugly game of penalties. At times during this game it was raining flags from all four corners of the field. Still not convinced they are a team worth worrying about. 
        <b>The Dallas Cowgirls are currently 1-2</b><br><br>Dallas Cowgirls first win was the only win so far this season. Most, if not all the blame should be on QB Dak Prescott. Overpaid and under delivering. He is the lone reason for Cowgirls 2 loses in a row. To be honest the staff at wedemboyz has no faith in the girls beating the Giants.
